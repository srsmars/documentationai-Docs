## Troubleshooting

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Page not publishing?">
    Check for syntax errors in MDX. Wrap special characters like `{variable}` or `<Component>` in backticks. Ensure frontmatter has no blank lines.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Slow previews?">
    Large images or complex components increase load time. Optimize assets and limit nested elements.
